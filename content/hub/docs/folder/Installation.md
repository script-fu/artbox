# Introduction

Artbox has an [AppImage](https://script-fu.github.io/artbox/hub/docs/folder/AppImage/) made for a Debian based system, that is available to download. If you are interested in building your own version from the source code then read on. Artbox is a modified version of GIMP, if you can build GIMP, you can build Artbox. The program relies on many parts to function and many apps are used to construct it. You need to create a _build environment_ for it first, like an aquarium for a fish. The following is a guide, for a Debian system. It will be a unique process for your system, and may require further research. Good luck!

## Git

Before we dive into building Artbox, you'll need to install and learn the basics of Git, a version control system that helps you manage and share source code. Git is an essential tool for any developer, and understanding how to use it will make the rest of the build process much easier. If you're new to Git, take a few minutes to read through [Using Git on Linux](https://script-fu.github.io/artbox/hub/guides/folder/using-git-on-linux/) to get up to speed.

## Dependencies

Here is the [official guide](https://developer.gimp.org/core/setup/build/linux/). The suggestion to look at [this](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) file, that builds GIMP in the GitLab CI environment, is worth following. That file lists all the dependencies the GIMP Dev build process needs. By using that information we can make a bash script to install those packages on our system. Save the following code block to a file called `install-GIMP-dep.sh` and execute it by following the instructions below.

To execute the script:

* Open a terminal in the script folder.
* Run the command `bash install-GIMP-dep.sh` to execute the script.

## Important

Be wary about executing shell scripts from the internet, have a look at the contents and try and understand roughly what it is doing. Alternatively copy it into an AI chatbot and ask _that_ what the script is doing.

  for package in "${FAILED_PACKAGES[@]}"; do
    echo "  $package"
  done
fi

read -n 1 -r -s -p "Press any key to exit"
```

## Install Location

After the Git challenge and package installation, we can proceed with the task. We'll keep the files we need in repository folders on the hard-drive, it's good to call the root folder `code`, then put in a sub-folder, like `gnome`, then another sub-folder `build` and one called `bash`

* Home
  * code
    * bash
    * gnome
      * build

These shell commands will create that little structure when run in a terminal, or you can do it using the File Manager.

```shell
mkdir $HOME/code
mkdir $HOME/code/bash
mkdir $HOME/code/gnome
mkdir $HOME/code/gnome/build
```

We are now ready to download from the internet, the source code files we need for our build environment. These files will be _cloned_ from existing repositories using Git and GitLab addresses.

## Clone the Source Code Repositories

In a terminal we can download the sources to our build directory using the `git clone` command:

```shell
cd $HOME/code/gnome/build
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/babl
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gegl
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp
git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/pixelmixer/artbox.git
```

The simple folder structure is now populated with thousands of files, and there's more to be made automatically by the build process.

* Home
  * code
    * bash
    * gnome
      * build
        * babl
        * gegl
        * gimp
        * artbox

## Environment Variables

The software that is about to be built, needs to know a few things about its environment. We do this by exporting some environmental variables. Copy the following into a file, call it **build_env.sh** and save it in the `bash` folder.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export GIMP_PREFIX="${HOME}/code/gnome"
export PATH="$GIMP_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"

# Capture the multi-os-directory
multi_os_directory=$(gcc -print-multi-os-directory 2>/dev/null)
if echo "$multi_os_directory" | grep ./ > /dev/null; then
  LIB_DIR=$(echo "$multi_os_directory" | sed 's/\.\.\///g')
else
  LIB_DIR="lib"
fi

# Capture the multiarch
multiarch=$(gcc -print-multiarch 2>/dev/null)
if echo "$multiarch" | grep . > /dev/null; then
  LIB_SUBDIR="${multiarch}/"
else
  LIB_SUBDIR=""
fi

# Export environment variables
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${GIMP_PREFIX}/${LIB_DIR}/${LIB_SUBDIR}pkgconfig${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:+:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${GIMP_PREFIX}/${LIB_DIR}/${LIB_SUBDIR}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
export XDG_DATA_DIRS="${GIMP_PREFIX}/share:/usr/share${XDG_DATA_DIRS:+:$XDG_DATA_DIRS}"
export GI_TYPELIB_PATH="${GIMP_PREFIX}/${LIB_DIR}/${LIB_SUBDIR}girepository-1.0${GI_TYPELIB_PATH:+:$GI_TYPELIB_PATH}"
```

## Build Artbox, BABL and GEGL

To build or run the software, we can use another shell script, that uses this file to build, compile or run the software. Copy the following and save it as `artbox.sh` in the bash folder. Then in your File Manager, right click the artbox.sh file, properties, permissions, `Allow executing file as program`.

Notice that BABL and GEGL are also being built, these two additional packages don't have to be built every time. When
COMPILE_ONLY is set to "true", after a full build perhaps, they are skipped.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script automates the build process for either Artbox (a GIMP fork) or
# GIMP itself. It includes optional steps to build libraries like BABL and GEGL
# It DEPENDS on "build_env.sh" being available in the same script directory

# Default configuration
COMPILE_ONLY="false"    # Set to "true" to compile without a full build

BUILD_BABL="true"       # Set to "false" to skip building BABL
BUILD_GEGL="true"       # Set to "false" to skip building GEGL
BUILD_FORK="artbox"     # Set to "gimp"  to build GIMP instead

# Find the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")"

# Save the initial directory to return to it later
INITIAL_DIR="$(pwd)"

# Load the environment variables
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/build_env.sh"

# Start in the build directory
cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/"

# A fast compile if requested, skip other the other builds
if [ "$COMPILE_ONLY" == "true" ]; then
  echo -e "\n*** Compiling $BUILD_FORK ***\n"

  # Update the git submodule for the chosen fork
  cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK"
  git submodule update

  # Create and navigate to the build directory
  mkdir -p "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK/_build"
  cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK/_build"

  # Run Ninja to compile
  ninja
  ninja install

  echo -e "\n*** Finished compiling $BUILD_FORK ***\n"

  # Return to the initial directory and pause before the exit
  cd "$INITIAL_DIR"
  sleep 3

  exit 0 # Early exit after compiling
fi

# Build BABL if enabled
if [ "$BUILD_BABL" == "true" ]; then
  echo -e "\n*** Building BABL ***\n"

  # Create and navigate to the build directory for BABL
  mkdir -p babl/_build
  cd babl/_build

  # Run Meson setup and build commands
  meson setup .. -Dprefix="${GIMP_PREFIX}"  --buildtype="release"
  ninja
  ninja install

  echo -e "\n*** Finished building BABL ***\n"
  cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/"
fi

# Build GEGL if enabled
if [ "$BUILD_GEGL" == "true" ]; then
  echo -e "\n*** Building GEGL ***\n"

  # Create and navigate to the build directory for GEGL
  mkdir -p gegl/_build
  cd gegl/_build

  # Run Meson setup and build commands
  meson setup .. -Dprefix="${GIMP_PREFIX}" --buildtype="release"
  ninja
  ninja install

  echo -e "\n*** Finished building GEGL ***\n"
  cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/"
fi

# Build the chosen version of GIMP (Artbox or GIMP)
echo -e "\n*** Building $BUILD_FORK ***\n"

# Update the git submodule for the chosen fork
cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK"
git submodule update

# Create and navigate to the build directory
mkdir -p "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK/_build"
cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/$BUILD_FORK/_build"

# Run Meson setup and build commands
meson setup .. -Dprefix="${GIMP_PREFIX}" --buildtype="release"
ninja
ninja install

echo -e "\n*** Finished building $BUILD_FORK ***\n"

# Return to the initial directory and pause before the exit
cd "$INITIAL_DIR"
sleep 3
```

To run the build script you can open a terminal in the bash folder and enter: `bash artbox.sh`

## Desktop Launcher (System Specific)

Alternatively you can launch Artbox using a desktop launcher, save the following as a file to your desktop, and then right click it, properties, permissions, `Allow executing file as program`.

```shell
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=gnome-terminal -- /home/your-home/code/bash/artbox.sh
Terminal=True
Icon=cinnamon-panel-launcher
Type=Application
Name[en_GB]=Artbox
```

You'll have to change `your-home` to get it to work, this is a Linux thing, on my system the line would be:

```sh
gnome-terminal -- /home/mark/code/bash/artbox.sh
```

It also assumes you are using a specific desktop environment (Cinnamon). My tip would be to look at how to create a desktop launcher for your particular system, or copy and edit an existing one you may have.

## Automatically Updating to the Latest Development Version

To update Artbox or GIMP to the latest development version, you can perform a 'hard' reset of the local repository to match the remote repository. **Warning:** This process will overwrite any local changes you have made to the code.

Here is a script that will get the latest versions of GIMP, Artbox, BABL and GEGL. Copy the following and save it as `reset-all-repos.sh` in the bash folder. Then in your File Manager, right click the `reset-all-repos.sh` file, properties, permissions, `Allow executing file as program`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script resets all the specified repositories (babl, gegl, artbox, and gimp)
# to their original states using 'git reset --hard', 'git clean -df', and ensures
# they are reset to the latest changes from their respective branches ('master' or 'artbox').
# If it's the gimp or artbox repo, a submodule update will be performed.
# It DEPENDS on "build_env.sh" being available in the same script directory.

# Flags to control whether to reset each repository
RESET_BABL="true"
RESET_GEGL="true"
RESET_GIMP="true"
RESET_ARTBOX="true"

# Find the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")"

# Save the initial directory to return to it later
INITIAL_DIR="$(pwd)"

# Load the environment variables
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/build_env.sh"

# Start in the build directory
cd "${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/"

# Positive warning message
echo "This script will reset selected repositories (babl, gegl, artbox, gimp) to their latest versions."
echo "Programmers! All uncommitted changes and untracked files will be lost."
echo -e "\nAre you sure you want to continue? (y)"

# User prompt
read -r CONFIRM

# Only proceed if the user confirms
if [ "$CONFIRM" != "y" ]; then
  echo "Operation canceled by the user."
  cd "$INITIAL_DIR"
  exit 1
fi

# Define the paths to the repositories and their respective branches
REPOS=()

if [ "$RESET_BABL" == "true" ]; then
  REPOS+=("${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/babl master")
fi
if [ "$RESET_GEGL" == "true" ]; then
  REPOS+=("${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/gegl master")
fi
if [ "$RESET_GIMP" == "true" ]; then
  REPOS+=("${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/gimp master")
fi
if [ "$RESET_ARTBOX" == "true" ]; then
  REPOS+=("${GIMP_PREFIX}/build/artbox artbox")
fi

# Loop through each repository, reset, clean, checkout branch, and fetch the latest changes
for REPO_INFO in "${REPOS[@]}"; do
  REPO=$(echo "$REPO_INFO" | awk '{print $1}')
  BRANCH=$(echo "$REPO_INFO" | awk '{print $2}')

  # Check if the repository exists
  if [ ! -d "$REPO" ]; then
    echo -e "Repository $REPO does not exist, skipping"
    continue
  fi

  # Navigate to the repository
  if cd "$REPO"; then
    # Checkout the correct branch
    git checkout -q "$BRANCH"
    # Fetch the latest changes from origin
    git fetch origin -q
    # Perform git reset and clean
    git reset --hard -q origin/"$BRANCH"
    git clean -df -q
    echo -e "Repository $REPO has been reset to the latest state on branch $BRANCH\n"

    # If the repository is gimp or artbox, perform a submodule update
    if [[ "$REPO" == *"gimp"* || "$REPO" == *"artbox"* ]]; then
      git submodule update --init --recursive -q
    fi
  else
    echo -e "Failed to navigate to $REPO"
  fi
done

# Return to the initial directory
cd "$INITIAL_DIR"
echo -e "Remember to rebuild all the repos to get the latest versions of the app!\n"
```

### Post Update

After running this script the next thing to do would be run the `artbox.sh` script with the control flags set as:

```plaintext
COMPILE_ONLY="false"
BUILD_BABL="true"
BUILD_GEGL="true" 
BUILD_FORK="artbox"
```

Then the version of Artbox will be the latest one to play with, and it'll be using the latest BABL and GEGL.

## Steps to Manually Update

1. **Navigate to the Local Repository:** First, go to the directory of the repository you want to update.
2. **Checkout the Desired Branch:** Switch to the branch you want to update. Make sure this is the branch you intend to reset.
3. **Fetch the Latest Data:** Retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository (origin).
4. **Reset to the Remote Branch:** Perform a hard reset to align your local branch with the remote branch. This will discard any local changes.
5. **Rebuild:** Repeat the [building](#build-artbox-babl-and-gegl) process by running the 'artbox.sh' script.

**Example commands to reset the artbox branch of the Artbox repo:**

```bash
cd ${HOME}/code/gnome/build/artbox/
git checkout artbox
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/artbox
```

### Explanation of Commands

* `git checkout artbox`: Switches to the 'artbox' branch. Replace 'artbox' with the name of the branch you want to update if different.

* `git fetch origin`: Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository (`origin`) but does not merge them into your local branch.

* `git reset --hard origin/artbox`: Resets your current branch to match the state of the `origin/artbox` branch. This is a 'hard' reset, meaning any local changes will be lost.

## Conclusion

At this point you will have the source code for Artbox, a build script and a desktop launcher. Double clicking the launcher should see a terminal and Artbox will open. There are many ways to make a build script, this is a starting point. If you got this far, congratulations!
