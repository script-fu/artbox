## Introduction

This series of guides is designed for those interested in building Artbox or GIMP locally. You'll find detailed instructions for installing Artbox, complete with example Bash scripts to guide you through the process.

For those looking to dive deeper, the 'Technical Guide' provides an in-depth look at the structure of an Artbox build and how it relates to GIMP. Additionally, the 'Data Guide' offers a closer examination of the GIMP 'gimp-data' folder. These technical guides are more advanced and aim to give you a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in building and customizing these applications.
