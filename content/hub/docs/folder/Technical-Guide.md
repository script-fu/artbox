## Branch Development Flow for GIMP to Artbox

The development process follows a staged pipeline architecture where the GIMP development branch serves as the foundation. Branches are organized into numbered stages that build upon each other, with each stage creating a checkpoint branch (`common-XX`) that serves as the foundation for the next stage. The final `artbox` branch represents the integrated work from all stages.

### Updating Artbox to GIMP Dev

Artbox uses a staged build pipeline to integrate GIMP development updates and branches. The process creates numbered checkpoint branches (`common-00`, `common-01`, etc.) that build upon each other to produce the final `artbox` branch.

#### Staged Construction Process

The build pipeline follows this flow:
```
GIMP Source → common-00 → common-01 → common-02 → ... → common-06 → artbox
```

Each stage processes a specific group of branches:

1. **Stage Setup:** Clone the previous stage's output branch
2. **Branch Integration:** Cherry-pick commits from assigned branches
3. **Checkpoint Creation:** Merge processed branches and create a single squashed commit
4. **Pipeline Progression:** Each stage builds on the previous stage's output

#### Key Benefits

- **Modular Updates:** Individual stages can be rebuilt without affecting the entire pipeline
- **Conflict Isolation:** Issues are contained within specific stages for easier resolution
- **Reproducible Builds:** Each stage creates a clean checkpoint for consistent results
- **Flexible Rebuilds:** Partial pipeline reconstruction allows targeted updates

#### Build Control

The construction process can be controlled at multiple levels:

- **Full Rebuild:** Process all stages from GIMP source to final artbox branch
- **Partial Rebuild:** Update only specific stages and downstream dependencies
- **Stage-by-Stage:** Enable or disable individual stages as needed

### Staged Branch Organization

All branches are organized into numbered stages to ensure conflict-free construction. The system focuses on ordering branches so that dependencies are resolved correctly and conflicts are minimized.

#### Stage Management

Stages provide flexible organization of branches:

- **Conflict Prevention:** Branches within the same stage are designed to work together without conflicts
- **Dependency Ordering:** Earlier stages prepare the foundation for later stages
- **Flexible Assignment:** Branches can be moved between stages as requirements change
- **Dynamic Expansion:** New stages can be inserted or appended as the project grows

#### Conflict Resolution

The staged approach simplifies conflict management:

- **Stage-Level Isolation:** Issues are contained within specific stages
- **Clear Dependencies:** Each stage builds on well-defined checkpoint branches
- **Selective Rebuilds:** Problem stages can be reconstructed without affecting the entire pipeline
- **Branch Reorganization:** Conflicting branches can be moved to different stages to resolve issues

When conflicts occur during pipeline construction, they can be resolved by:
- Moving problematic branches to later stages
- Inserting new intermediate stages to separate conflicting changes
- Reordering branches within stages to optimize integration

### Notes

The staged pipeline architecture provides flexible stage organization:

- **Unified Branch Management:** All branches are treated equally and organized purely by integration requirements
- **Dynamic Reorganization:** Branches can be moved between stages to optimize the build process
- **Scalable Architecture:** New stages can be easily inserted or appended to accommodate project growth
- **Conflict-Driven Organization:** Stage assignments are based on preventing conflicts rather than branch functionality

This approach provides maximum flexibility for managing complex integrations while maintaining a clean, reproducible build process.
