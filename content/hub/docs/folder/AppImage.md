# Introduction

The GIMP development team are experimenting with AppImages. An AppImage is a version of the application that can be downloaded as one file, it is then started by double clicking that file. If it fails to launch with an error "Unknown file type", set permissions on the file to be run as an executable. Right click the file, properties -> permissions -> allow executing file as program. Then try double clicking it again.

This AppImage for Artbox has been built for nearly all Linux distos: [download](https://gitlab.gnome.org/pixelmixer/artbox/-/raw/feature-appimage/AppImage/Artbox.AppImage?ref_type=heads&inline=false)

The AppImage is from the GitLab CI build of the artbox branch in the [Artbox](https://gitlab.gnome.org/pixelmixer/artbox/-/commits/artbox?ref_type=heads) repository
