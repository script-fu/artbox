# Introduction

The GIMP development team are experimenting with AppImages. An AppImage is a version of the application that can be downloaded as one file, it is then started by double clicking that file. You may also have to set permissions on the file to be run as an executable, right click the file, properties->permissions->allow executing file as program.
