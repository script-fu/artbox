## Fullscreen is Fullscreen

**Current State**: Fullscreen mode shows Docks.

**Issue**: User has to use two shortcuts to enter Fullscreen mode.

**Solution**: Also Hide or Show docks when toggling Fullscreen.

**Benefits**: No more annoying two step Fullscreen mode, feels like a bug fix rather than a feature. No information on why it was a two step process has been forthcoming.
