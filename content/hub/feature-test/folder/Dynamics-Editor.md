| **Revision**               | **Current Design**                                           | **Issues**                                                                                             | **Changes**                                                                                               |

| **1. Mapping Matrix**       | See GIMP Dynamics Editor                                     | Awkward labels like `Aspect Ratio` and `Rotation/Wheel` detract from the interface. Checkboxes lack margins, causing labels to overlap. The Mapping Matrix is not scrollable, making the Dynamics Editor dock excessively large and difficult to reduce in size. The large array of checkboxes complicates identification of their function. | Renamed awkward labels, added margins around checkboxes, added tooltips for each checkbox, and enclosed the Mapping Matrix in a scrollable window. |
| **2. Output Editors: Reset Confirmation** | See GIMP Dynamics Editor                              | Reset Curve removes user data without warning, leading to potential accidental loss of work.            | Added a confirmation dialog that prompts users before resetting curves, reducing the risk of unintended data loss. |
| **3. Output Editors: Copy and Paste** | There is no way to copy a curve.                      | Lack of copy functionality makes it difficult to reuse or transfer curve data, reducing workflow efficiency. | Added `Copy Curve` and `Paste Curve` buttons. Curves are saved as text files, enabling persistence between sessions and easy sharing. |
| **4. Dynamic Attributes**   | See GIMP Dynamics Editor                                     | The Dynamic Attributes treeview is not in a scrollable window, making the Dynamics Editor dock excessively large and inflexible. | Enclosed the Dynamic Attributes treeview in a scrollable window to improve layout flexibility and reduce dock size. |

#### **Key Changes**

- **Mapping Matrix Improvements**:
   - Renamed awkward labels like `Aspect Ratio` and `Rotation/Wheel` for clarity.
   - Added margins to checkboxes to prevent label overlap and improve layout consistency.
   - Included tooltips for each checkbox to explain its function.
   - Enclosed the Mapping Matrix in a scrollable window, reducing the minimum size of the Dynamics Editor dock and enhancing interface flexibility.

- **Output Editor Reset Confirmation**:
   - Implemented a confirmation dialog that warns users before resetting curves.
   - This ensures that user data is not lost unintentionally, improving overall reliability.

- **Copy and Paste Curve Functionality**:
   - Introduced `Copy Curve` and `Paste Curve` buttons for reusing and sharing curve data.
   - Enabled saving curve points to text files, allowing persistence between sessions and simplifying data management.

- **Dynamic Attributes Treeview**:
   - Enclosed the Dynamic Attributes treeview in a scrollable window, reducing the size constraints of the Dynamics Editor dock.
   - This update provides a more flexible layout and ensures that the interface remains compact and manageable.

### **Benefits**

- **Improved Usability**: The updated Mapping Matrix layout, scrollable treeviews, and added tooltips enhance clarity and accessibility, making it easier to navigate and use the Dynamics Editor.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Copy and paste functionality reduces repetitive work, enabling users to quickly duplicate or share curve data.
- **Data Protection**: The reset confirmation dialog safeguards user data, ensuring no unintended loss of work.
- **Flexible Interface**: Scrollable windows for the Mapping Matrix and Dynamic Attributes treeview reduce dock size constraints, allowing users to customize their workspace more effectively.
