| **Revision**               | **Current Design**                                           | **Issues**                                                                                             | **Changes**                                                                                               |

| **1. Icon Picker Update**  | The icon picker is very small on HDPI screens.              | Limited icon visibility reduces ease of use and impacts feature discoverability.                        | Added a new `icon_tool_preset` boolean property to adjust the icon picker size in the Tool Preset Editor. Enlarged and centered the icon picker for better visibility and usability. |
| **2. Tool Preset Information Table** | **New Feature** | Users lack insight into the saved and active states of resources linked to Tool Presets, hindering editing and creation workflows. | Implemented an information table that clearly displays the saved and active states of resources associated with Tool Presets. |
| **3. Resource Reloading Options** | Tool Preset Editor options are listed without context. | Unorganized options create a cluttered interface and lead to an oversized dock, reducing efficiency.   | Grouped related options under a collapsible "Resource Reloading" frame using an expandable widget. Added explanatory tooltips for clarity. |
| **4. Linked Resource Saving Options** | **New Feature** | There are no options for managing linked resources when creating new Tool Presets.                     | Introduced an expandable "Linked Resource Saving" frame that provides toggleable options for managing linked resources. These options apply when saving Tool Presets or linked resources. |
| **5. Linked Resource Save-As Feature** | **New Feature** | No streamlined method for creating additional presets with named copies of linked resources.            | Added a "Save As" button and menu option to save linked resources with new names. Implemented a dialog that provides a guided workflow for naming and saving linked resources along with Tool Presets. |
