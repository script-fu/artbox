## Design Revisions

| **Revision**  | **Current Design**  | **Issues**  | **Changes** |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Selection Mask Highlighting** | Rectangle selection highlighting is on a few tools, and is not global | Knowing if there is an active selection can be an issue. Working without selection borders becomes difficult. Changing tools loses the selection highlighting. | Draw a shaded overlay that masks out unselected areas. Additional preference options for the shade alpha and colour |
| **2. Selection Borders**   | New Feature | No way to adjust the thickness or harshness of selection borders | Added preferences to adjust the selection border |

### **Benefits**

These updates allow the user to work without selection borders, or with softer selection borders. With accurate selection area shading, knowing what content is editable becomes more intuitive.
