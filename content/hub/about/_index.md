Artbox is a version of GIMP made for **Linux**, focused on digital painting and illustration. It was created by an artist and is maintained for daily, practical use.

Updates improve the stability of the GIMP base and add small features to help the workflow. Artbox Stable is tested for reliability, while Artbox receives updates more often with new fixes and features.

Practical notes:
- Artbox keeps its own .config directory (named "Artbox") and separate data resource folders to avoid altering GIMP user data.
- For safer work make use of Incremental Saving and use the Almost-Autosave plugin with an autostart command.
