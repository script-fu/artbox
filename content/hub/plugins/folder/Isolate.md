# Introduction

This plugin allows the user to isolate a selection of layers or groups. If the selection hasn't changed since it last ran, it toggles the isolation mode off again. There's a second plugin, exit isolation that simply exits the isolated state.  

See it in action on Youtube [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlcMF0uuW3A)
