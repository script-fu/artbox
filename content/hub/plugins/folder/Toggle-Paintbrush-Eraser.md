## Introduction

This plug-in allows the user to toggle between the Paintbrush Tool and the Eraser tool. It also uses the "Eraser" slider value to scale the eraser size.

### Plug-in Menu Location

_Tools -> Paint Tools -> Toggle Paintbrush Eraser_

### Keyboard Shortcut

This forces Artbox to save the shortcut for the next session. First, search for the plug-in name, and assign a shortcut.

_Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts_

Once the shortcut is working as you like, save your work then;  

_File -> Quit_

When Artbox restarts, your plug-in should be activated by the assigned key.
