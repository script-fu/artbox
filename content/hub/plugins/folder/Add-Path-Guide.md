title: Add Path Guide
type: docs
---

## Introduction

This plug-in adds a simple path with two points at the bottom of the image. It is ready to use as a flexible guide. Artbox locks this path, so it cannot be designed or edited, only moved.

It is a fast way to add a ruler or flexible guide for drawing straight lines and curves when `Snap to Active Path` is turned on.

### Plug-in Menu Location

_Tools -> Paint Tools -> Add Path Guide_

### Keyboard Shortcut

This forces Artbox to save the shortcut for the next session. First, search for the plug-in name, and assign a shortcut.

_Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts_

Once the shortcut is working as you like, save your work then;  

_File > Quit_

When Artbox restarts, your plug-in should be activated by the assigned key.
