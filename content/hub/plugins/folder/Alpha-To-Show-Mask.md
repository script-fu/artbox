## Introduction

This plug-in toggles a layerâ€™s alpha channel into a mask in Show Mask mode, which is useful for finding stray pixels. On the first run, it converts the alpha channel into a mask, shows it, and switches the foreground and background colours to black and white. On the second run, it applies the mask, restoring the layer to an alpha-only state, and puts your original colours back as the active FG/BG.
