## Introduction

Some of these plugins are exclusive to Artbox, as they use additional commands not available in GIMP. They are generally written using Script-Fu, a Scheme based scripting language that is part of GIMP. They install as part of Artbox when it is built locally or can be found in the AppImage download.
