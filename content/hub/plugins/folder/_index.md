## Introduction

Some of these plugins are exclusive to Artbox, as they use additional commands not available in GIMP. They are generally written using Script-Fu, a Scheme based scripting language that is part of GIMP. They install as part of Artbox to the data resource folders when it is built locally, or can be found bundled in the AppImage download.

If you wish to deactivate these plugins you can do so by changing your preferences in Artbox.

Edit -> Preferences -> Folders -> Plug-ins  

Remove the share/artbox/ path.
