# Introduction

This is an attempt at an Autosave feature! It saves a numbered version of the open files that have been edited into a named folder. It does not save over the opened file. You do have to start the Autosave manually each session, it's almost an autosave.

* Autosave Folder
  * File Name
    * autosave_1.xcf
    * autosave_2.xcf
    * autosave_3.xcf

## Plugin Menu Location 

_File -> Almost Autosave_

## Keyboard Shortcut

This forces Artbox to save the shortcut for the next session. Search for the plugin name, and assign a shortcut.

_Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts_

Once the shortcut is working as you like, save your work then;  

_File -> Quit_
