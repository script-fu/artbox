# Introduction

This is an incremental save feature. It saves a numbered version of the active file into a named sub-folder. It does not save over the opened file. Each image can have a unique number of saves, before the saves wrap around. Useful to save stages of progress, before committing to a proper save. Also good for recovering an earlier version.

* Image Folder
