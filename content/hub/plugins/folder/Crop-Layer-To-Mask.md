This plug-in crops the selected layers to the content of the layer mask with an optional margin.

### Plug-in Menu Location

_Layer > Crop Layer to Mask_

### Keyboard Shortcut

This forces Artbox to save the shortcut for the next session. First, search for the plug-in name, and assign a shortcut.

Once the shortcut is working as you like, save your work then;

When Artbox restarts, your plug-in should be activated by the assigned key.
